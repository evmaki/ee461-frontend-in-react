# ee461-frontend-in-react
This is a minimal repo containing example code for my lecture given in the Fall 2022 semester of UT Austin EE461L, Software Engineering & Design. 

This code demonstrates a basic user login flow implemented in React. A PDF of my lecture slides is also included in this repo for your convenience.
